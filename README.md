# sample-t-test
The app allows users to input summary statistics (sample size, mean, and standard deviation) and perform hypothesis testing with configurable significance levels. It computes the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and provides a clear decision on rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis.
